> **_NOTE:_**  The assignment was done on google sheets instead of microsoft excel due to licensing issues. Google sheets provide google Apps Script instead and no way to download that sheet with macros included. Hence the sheet doesn't contain the macros. 

Link to sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M2gI3j2gs2cMe9gIcWjpY0QlJcSmgO4DTmU1g4dspUQ/edit?usp=sharing

The macros have been exported separately in the scripts directory with a separate file for each Task named as `q1.js .. q8.js`.

Or you can also run all the tasks together using `all.js` file.

Follow the following steps to import the Apps scripts as macros in your google sheet:

`Extensions -> Macros -> Import Macro`

then copy past the javascript code and import the functions.

To run the same you can follow the following steps:

```Extensions -> Macros -> click on the name of the macro to execute```


> **_NOTE:_** You need to be on the sheet where you want to execute the macro
